# Introduction

This is a simple example of a genetic algorithm that solves the problem of finding a list of `n` numbers that added together are equal to a value `x` using tournament selection.

On the base version the target value is 250 and the size of each individual is 6, each digit varies between 0 and 300.

Each generation has 100 individuals and the crossover and mutation probability are 80% and 10% respectively. You can modify this parameters in the main function.

# Installation

First install python3 and create a virtual environment (i advice using virtualenvwrapper), then install all requirements running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

If you dislike the colors you can change them on the global variables settings.
